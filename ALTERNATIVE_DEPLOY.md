# Alternative: Deploy Without Downloading

Since you're having trouble downloading files, here are other ways to deploy your app:

## Option 1: Use Replit's Built-in Deploy (Easiest)
1. Look for a "Deploy" button in the top-right of your Replit workspace
2. Click it and follow the prompts
3. You'll get a live URL instantly
4. No file downloads needed

## Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. In your Replit workspace, look for the "Version control" tab (Git icon)
2. Connect to GitHub and push your code
3. Go to vercel.com and connect your GitHub repository
4. Deploy directly from GitHub

## Option 3: Copy Files Manually
I can help you copy the essential files one by one:

### Essential Files Needed:
1. `package.json` - Project configuration
2. `client/` folder - All frontend files
3. `server/` folder - All backend files
4. `shared/` folder - Shared types
5. `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
6. `README.md` - Documentation

### Steps:
1. Create a new folder on your computer called "reading-tracker"
2. I'll show you the content of each file
3. Copy and paste each file into your local folder
4. Upload to Vercel

## Option 4: Simple ZIP Creation
Let me create a downloadable ZIP file for you using the terminal.

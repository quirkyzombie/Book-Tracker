# Manual Copy-Paste Deployment Guide

Since file downloads are having issues, here's how to manually recreate your project:

## Step 1: Create Project Structure
On your computer, create a new folder called "reading-tracker" with these folders:
```
reading-tracker/
├── client/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── lib/
│   │   └── pages/
│   └── public/
├── server/
├── shared/
```

## Step 2: Copy Essential Files
I'll show you the content of each essential file that you need to copy:

### Root Files:
- `package.json` - Project configuration
- `vercel.json` - Deployment settings
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - CSS processing

### Client Files:
- `client/index.html` - Main HTML file
- `client/src/main.tsx` - App entry point
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Main app component
- All component files in `client/src/components/`
- All page files in `client/src/pages/`

### Server Files:

## Step 3: Copy File Contents
I can show you the exact content of each file to copy and paste.

Would you like me to start showing you the file contents one by one?
